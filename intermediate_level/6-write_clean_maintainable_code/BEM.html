    <!--  
      BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular naming convention, the idea of BEM 
        is to think our webpage as a bounch of blocks or components. This blocks
        contain elements and can be modified.
      A block is called a 'Card', a Card can contain elements, like a Header (inside it
      we can have other elements), or other blocks.
      A Modifier is a version of a block but restyled to call attention.

      BEM convention:
        - We use double hyphens (--) to separate a block from a modifier.
        - We use two underscores (__) to separate a block from an element.

    <!--  
        Using the BEM convention.
          For blocks we have to separate the prefix from the proper class
            name, using two underscores.
          For modifiers, if we want this card to be the one that is restyled, we have to
            give an extra class to this block, using two hyphens (--).

          The name of the button is not going to be 'card__body', because button is an 
            indipendent block or component, that can exist outside of this block.
