  <!--  
  Object Oriented CSS is based on two principles:
    1- Separate container from content.
    2- Separate structure and skin
  -->
  <style>
    /*
      In this example the '.btn' is the content and the '.hero' or '.side_bar' is the container.
      We want to separate the content from the container, like the following
      
      previous -->  .hero .btn {
                      background: gold;
                      border: 0;
                      border-radius: 30px;
                      padding: 1rem 2rem;
                    }
    */
    .btn {
      background: gold;
      border: 0;
      border-radius: 30px;
      padding: 1rem 2rem;
      font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
    }

    /* 
      We can have a single class '.btn' that we only apply to an element that we want to style in
      a certain way.
    */

    /* 
      For the second principle, we can see that the button has some structure wich is difined
      by the properties, and it also has some skin, some shell, in this case the skin is the color.
      So we want to have a button class that purely defines the structure without the background color.
      After that we define a second class for defining a skin (color), this is where we use the background
      color
    */
    .btn2 {
      background: gold;
      border: 0;
      border-radius: 30px;
      padding: 1rem 2rem;
      font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
    }

    .btn2-primary {
      background-color: gold;
    }
    .btn2-secondary {
      background: dodgerblue;

<body>
  <!--  
    Lets say we have a container with a button.
  -->
  <div class="hero">
    <button class="btn">Submit</button>
  </div>

  <!-- 
    Now we add a sidebar, you will see that the button here, doesnt have the 
    same styles that the above button. 
    Duplication is bad we want to keep the code as DRY as possible.
    Here is where the 1st ptinciple of OOCSS comes to play.
  -->
  <aside class="side_bar">
    <button class="btn">Contact</button>
  </aside>

  <!--  
    To explain the second principle, lets say we want to make another same button,
    but in this case with blue background.
    To do this 1st we need to add a second name to the button class, adding as a prefix 
    the element class that we want to copy the styles from, in this case:
  -->
  <div class="hero">
    <button class="btn2 btn2-primary">Submit</button>
  </div>

  <aside class="side_bar">
    <button class="btn2 btn2-secondary">Contact</button>
  </aside>
</body>
