    <!-- 
        We are going to see 8 techniques that are going to help us write cleaner
        and more maintainable CSS.

        1- Follow a naming convention. 
            Stack to a naming convention that you use
              .nav-bar - This is called kebab case, we separate multiple words using
                        a hypen.
              .navBar - Camel case, here the firsrt letter of the first word should
                        be lowercase. But the first letter of every word after should
                        be uppercase.
              .NavBar - Pascal case, with pascal case the first leter of every word
                        should be uppercase.
              .nav_bar - Snake case, With it you separate multiple words using an 
                        underscore.

        2- Create logical sections in your stylesheet. 
            For large projects is probably that its convenient to split stylessheet 
              into multiple style, and then combinethem together (this is when we use 
              CSS preprocessors tools like Sass and LESS).
            For small projects with single stylesheet, you dont want to write all your 
              styles in one place, its better to logically separate them in different 
              containers.

          3- Avoid over-specific selectors.
              Suppose you have the following elements
                <html>
                div class="nav">
                  <ul class="items">
                    <il>1</il>
                    <il>2</il>
                    <il>3</il>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <css>
                div.nav > ul.items > li {}

              You want to avoid this type of selection, because it becomes hard to mantain
                overtime. We should reduce the specificty of the selector.
              The first thing to do is remove direct child selectors '>', because the rule
                adjust to much to the structure, if in the future we would wrap the <ul>
                element with a <div> the rule would break. -> div.nav ul.items li {}
              The second thing is that the rule is to tight to the title of the HTML
                element, if the container changes the element or the class would change the 
                name, the rule will breake. So to prevent this we should remove the type
                of the HTML element -> .nav .items li {}
              Also a good thing is to give the <li> element a class, so the element type 
                doesnt matter -> .nav .items .item {}
              We can make this simpler, by removing the second selector, as long we have
                an element of class '.item' inside our '.nav', the rule is gonna work.

                .nav .item {}
              This si simpler but writting code like this could lead to stepping on the
                styles applied to the '.item' class.

                .item {} -> This will step on the below rule.

                .nav .item {} 
              
              To prevent this we can use a prefix over the '.item' -> '.nav-item', with
                this we are representing and item inside our .nav component, if we do
                this we have to name the class in the HTML file.
                    <il class='nav-item'>1</il>
                    <il class='nav-item'>2</il>
                    <il class='nav-item'>3</il>
              
              By doing this we dont need the '.nav' selector

              .nav-bar {}
        
        4- Avoid the '!important' keyword. 
            If you have to use this keyword it meas that you did somthing 
              wrong somewhere else (probably an over specific selector).
        
        5- Sort CSS properties.
            We can do this using VSCode, suppose you have the next
              rule:
                  .nav-item {
                    color: tomato;
                    width: 100%;
                    background: #fff;
                    font-weight: bold;
                  }
              First, we select just the properties, and then go to the command palette 
                (ctr + shift + p), and search for 'Sort Lines Ascending'
                  .nav-item {
                    background: #fff;
                    color: tomato;
                    font-weight: bold;
                    width: 100%;
                  }
        
        6- Take advantage of style inheritance.
            One example is when we select the font-family in the html {} rule, we
              do that so we assign the same font to the entire elements. So we dont
              have to declare the same rule in each element.
        
        7- Extract repetitive patterns in your stylessheet.
            This is part we covered in the lesson of 'Object-oriented CSS'.
        
        8- Avoid repetitive values (keep it DRY).
            DRY = Dont Repeate Yourselves
