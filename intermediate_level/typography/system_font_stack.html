    <title>System Font Stack</title>
    <!-- 
        Another concept to know about fonts is the concept of the SYSTEM FONT STACK. With this stack, we can tell
        the browser to use the default font of the operating system on the user's computer.
        This has some benefits:
        * Can boost performance - browser doesnt has to donwload any font files.
        * No flash of unstyled text (FOUT).
        * Website looks more familiar to the user (native look), because they see the same font as on their computer.

        But there is a problem with this approach, this is that, the deafault font on each operative system is
        different.
