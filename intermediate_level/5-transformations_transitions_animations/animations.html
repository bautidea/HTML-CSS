    <!--  
      We can use the 'transition' property to animate one or more properties, we 
      apply this property to the container not to the hover state.

      As we said earlyer the 'transition' property is suitable for really 
      simple animations, for anything more complex, we'll have to use the 
      'animate' property.

      For example what if we want to apply multiple transformations, and then
      control the timiing or speed of each transformation, with 'transition'
      we have a single place to do this (inside this property).
      Here is when we need to create a custom animation.

      /*
        We are gonna start by defining a bunch of keyframes. CSS animations
        can have several frames.
        The key frame is followed by the name of the animation that we want 
        to create, and then in that block, we define our keyframes. For each
        keyframe we specify a percentage of the time though the animation 
        sequence.

        '0%' represents the 1st frame, and 100% is the last frame. You can space
        the keyframes like you want to.

        After creating the animations on each keyframe we have to assign it 
        to the element.
      */
      @keyframes pop {
        0% {
          transform: scale(1);
        }

        25% {
          transform: scale(1.3);
        }

        50% {
          transform: rotate(45deg);
          background: tomato;
        }

        100% {
          transform: rotate(0deg);
        }
      }

      /*
        First we assign the keyfram using the property 'animation-name', then
        we stablish a duration with 'animation-duration'. 
        Properties we need to know.
        * 'animation-delay' - time to wait before the animation starts.
        * 'animation-iteration-count' - we can specify how many times we want
        to run the animation, default value is 1,but we can say 'infinite' if 
        we want to create a loop
        * 'animation-timing-function' - determines the animation progression
        over time.
        * 'animation-direction' - the default value is 'normal' which plays
        the animation from start to end. But we can change the animation to 
        'reverse', to start from the end. Also we can use 'alterante' to
        alternate between normal and reverse.

        We also have a shorthand property, if you type 'ani' and see on VScode
        recomendations, and press enter in the 1st recomendation.
