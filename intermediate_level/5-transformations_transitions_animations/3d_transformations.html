    <!-- 
      Now we are going to talk about dimensional transformation.
      We can move this box along the axis-z, so we can move an element closer
      of further from us.

        Before calling the translateZ() function, we have to use 'perspective'
        function to define a virtual space. The value we pass is going to 
        indicate the distance betweeen us and the box, this is just an
        arbitrary value, it doesnt matter what we pass.

        We can rotate the element along the the vertical axis. You will see
        that by default the rotation point of the element is at the center,
        but we can easily move the origin of transformation, with the property
        'transform-origin', we have to use two values, one for the x offset
        and the other for the Y. If we use '0 0' it means top left corner
        of the box.

      /*
        Lets say we want to transform the two b3 boxes a a whole, for that
        we need to wrap this boxes inside a container, and we apply these
        transformation to it.

        transform: perspective(200px) rotateY(45deg);

      /* 
        If we want to apply different transformations to different elements
        in the container, we apply the transformation to individual elements
        inside this container.
        With this implementation, each box will get its own perspective, to
        get this more real, we want to make sure that all these elements share
        the same perspective.
        So we need to define a rule to the container before applying these
        transformations to the individual elements.

        NOTE: in CSS we have a perspective function that we apply as part of
        a transformation. But we also have a property, which we apply to the 
        parent or a container element.
