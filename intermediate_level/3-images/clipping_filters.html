    <!--
        In CSS we can easily clip or cut a part of an image. Go to google and search 
        'css clip generator'.

        We can also apply filter to our images (grayscale, blur, contrast, brightness, etc.)
        To see all filter funtions just google 'css filter functions'
    -->
    <style>
      /* After we selected our desired shape we copy the css property and paste it here */
      .meal {
        clip-path: polygon(
          0% 20%,
          60% 20%,
          60% 0%,
          100% 50%,
          60% 100%,
          60% 80%,
          0% 80%
        );
        /* Grayscale is a function and we can pass it a value or an argument */
        filter: grayscale(70%);
