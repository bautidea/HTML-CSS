    <!--  
      SVG are defined by mathematical vectors (lines, curves, etc.), so they are not tied to pixels
      and they always look sharp at any size.

      SVG files are quite often used for logos, icons, simple graphics, and backgrounds, a usefull web 
      page to get SVG background files is svgbackgrounds.com.

      SVG files are really powerfull and they are also super small.
