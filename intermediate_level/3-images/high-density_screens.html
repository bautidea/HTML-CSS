    <title>Supporting High-density Screens</title>
    <!--  
        WARNING: you only wanna use this technique if you have a beautiful homepage with images 
        that should look super sharp.
        Also this technique is for fixed size images (in this example we are displaying a image 
        with a fixed width of 400 px), to render images at different sizes, depending on the 
        screen resolution of the device we should use the 'Resolution Switching' technique.
        
        Now a days we have a lot of high density screens with more pixels, and that is something
        we have to take into account when displaying images.
        The devices these days have a few properties:
        * Physical resolution: Based on the actual number of pixels on the device. (eg: iphone 4 
        has a physical resolution of 960 x 640 pixels).
        * Logical resolution: It's basically how they behave (eg: iphone 4 has a logical resolution
        of 480 x 320 pixels).
        * Device Pixel Ratio (DPR): Which is the ratio of physical to logical pixels (Physical / Logical)
        (eg: iphone 4 has a DPR of 2). But different screens have diferents DPRs.

        A high-density screen is a screen with a DPR greater than 1.
        CSS is always based on the logical resolution, so when we say 200 px in CSS, we are talking 
        about the logical resolution.

        There is a problem with this, if DPR is greater than one then each pixel of the image will get
        rendered, so the image is going to get resized and by scaling it, the image will look blurry.
        For this image to look sharp we have to provide a second version of this image that is twice as
        big, and the display it at the original size.
        We can scale this image using photoshop.

      .meal {
        width: 400px;
      }

      .high-density-example {
        width: 100%;
      }

      div {
        width: 100%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- 
        To provide different versions of this image for high-density screens, we are gonna use
        'srcset' atribute. With it we can provide a set of sources for different screens, we provide
        the image we want and then the device pixel ratio. So if the device pixel ratio is 1 the 1st 
        image is going to be shown.
