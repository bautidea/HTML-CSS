    <!-- 
        We have another way for displaying iconsm, we can use icon fonts. These icon fonts
        are special fonts.
        They are so many icon fonts, the most popular one are:
        * Font Awesome
        * Ionicons
        * Material Design Icons

        For this example we went into fontawesome.com and generated a script.
    -->
    <script
      src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/2b71ffd861.js"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    ></script>
    <style>
      .icon_container {
        font-size: 2rem;
        color: dodgerblue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="/img/icon_fonts.png" alt="" />

    <!--
      If you look at the name you will notice that:
      * The first class is fa-solid which is short for 'Font Awsome - Solid'.
      * The second class is fa-dragon which is short for 'Font Awesome - Dragon'.
      If we change the word 'dragon' for another icon we want it will display it
      (eg fa-bell).

      We can also change the size and color of this icon, Font Awesome provides a 
      number of utility classes, to do this, for example fa-2x, this will make this
      icon twice as big, relative to the font size of its parent.

      To better control the size of this icon, we can wrap it inside a <span> element, 
      the icon elemnt will inherit the font size and color properties of its parent.
    -->
    <span class="icon_container">
      <i class="fa-solid fa-dragon fa-2x"></i>
    </span>

    <!-- 
      If you dont like to wrap the icon in a <i> element, you can use a <span> element.
    -->
    <span class="icon_container">
      <span class="fa-solid fa-bell fa-2x"></span>
    </span>
  </body>
