    <title>CSS Sprites</title>
    <!--  
        CSS Sprites is an optimization technique.
        One thing that we need to have in mind is that to get each image, on our browser is sending
        a separate HTTP request to the server. If you have a page with tons of images and millons
        of concurrent users, all these users are going to send millions of request to our server

        With this technique we can combine all these imges into a single image, and then get that iamge
        using a single HTTP request. 

        We need to go to http://cssspritestool.com/ ,  if this web might be down just search in google for 
        'css sprites generator'.

        WARNING!! : Dont try to combine all your images in a single CSS Sprite. It doesnt make sense for two
        reasons - 
        * We dont want to combine big images into a single CSS Sprite will end up with a really large file.
        * CSS Sprites are not flexible, so if we want to replace one image, we have to regenerate the CSS Sprite

        We should use this approach with small images, like logos or icons.

    <!--  
      To load our CSS Sprites generated image, we are going to add a bounch of span elements with the class
      that is indicated in our stylesheet (the class name comes by default from the css sprites file).
      With this new implementation our browser is sending a single HTTP request to the server thats verified.
