        to see content images.

      /* 
            By seting the image width bigger than the original image, our image will look blurry, because
            the original image has a size of 400px x 400px, but we are showing it at a much bigger size
            and we dont have enought pixels or data about those missing details.
            This is the problem with raster images, SVG files dont have this problem, but it isnt possible
            to imitate this image using mathematics like SVG.

        Sometimes images can be used for decorations.
        When that is the usecase we should set the 'alt' attribute to an empty string, because
        if the image wouldnt be loaded the screen readers will read the name of the file instead of 
        the 'alt' atribute
