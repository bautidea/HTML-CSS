    <!--  
        Sometimes we want to show as a zoomed in or cropped version for certain screen sizes,
        this is called 'Art Direction', check it on earls.ca (scaling the viewport).
        We can also apply this technique to backgrounds.
        To implement Art Direction, we are going to use the <picture> element.

    <!-- 
        To implement Art direction we are going to use the 'media' atribute, in which we can type
        a media condition.
        Pay attention that we cropped the image before using it.
