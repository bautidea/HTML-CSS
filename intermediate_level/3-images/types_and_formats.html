    <title>Image Types and Formats</title>
    <!-- 
        In computers we  have two types of images, 'Raster' which are made up of pixels and 
        'Vector' wich are defined by a set of mathematical vectors, like lines and curves.
        We use raster images for photos and vector images for simple graphics, icon, logos, etc.

        Raster often comes from cammeras / scanner but they can also be produced by software. Any 
        extension of JPG, PNG, GIF, etc is essentially a raster. The larger the image the more pixels
        we need, and that results in a larger file size.
        In the web we dont wanna serve large images, because downloading them takes time, but we dont 
        want to server small images because, this images looks blurry if you scale them up.

        Vector images are created in software (like Adobe illustrator for example). The extension of this
        image is SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics), this graphics are scalable and they always look sharp
        at any size.
