    <title>Using Modern Image Formats</title>
    <!-- 
      In this lesson we are going to talk about WebP modern image format.
      To convert images to this modern format we can use, Photoshop (we have to download
      WebPShop plugin) or we can search for a converter in the internet, one page to use
      can be cloudconvert.com.
      Its better to use WebP because the file sizes are a lot smaller, but this format is 
      not vastly supported, go to caniuse.com to check its support.

  <body>
    <!-- 
      There are two ways we can use this image, using the <img> element, however if a user
      doesnt support this format the image wont be displayed, so if you dont care about Internet
      Exporer users you can use the <img> element.
    -->
    <img src="/img/meal.webp" alt="" />

    <!--  
      If you want to support internet explorer, or any other browser that don't support these modern 
      formats, then we would have to use the <picture> element.
      Each picture can have multiple sources.
      First we set the type of the image followed by the subtype.
    -->
    <picture>
      <!-- Since we are using the 'srcset' atribute we could pass different versions for high-density screens -->
      <source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/meal.webp" />
      <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/img/meal.jpg" />
      <!-- 
        We should always add an image element for two reasons
        * This si where we're going to type the alternative text.
        * To support browsers that don't support the <picture> or the <source> element.
      -->
      <img src="/img/meal.jpg" alt="A bowl of salmon and curry." />
    </picture>
