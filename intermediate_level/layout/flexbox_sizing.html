    <!--
      Now for sizing there are some properties that we need to remember
      'flex-basis' its used for setting the initial size of a flex item.
      'flex-grow'  for setting the growth factor.
      'flex-shrink' for setting the shrink factor, it tells the beowser how the element should shrink
      if there is no space to fit in the container.
      'flex' it combines all the top three properties.
      All these properties are for flex ITEMS and not flex containers.
