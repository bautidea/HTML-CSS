    <title>Data List</title>
    <!-- 
        With data list we can implement a suggestion list.
        One thing to be aware off is that, how the list looks and feels  depends
        on the browser, if we want to make sure that the sugestion list looks 
        consistent across diferent browsers we have to style it ourselves, using
        JavaScript.

        Because if we define a rule in CSS for our <datalist> or <option> element
        the styles defined there wont be applied, the browsers default size will
        take over.

    <form>
      <!--  
        With a simple text field, we want to provide a list of suggestions when 
        the user types something into this text field.
      -->
      <input type="text" list="countries" />
      <!--  
        After this input field, we defina a <datalist> element, inside it we can 
        a bounch of options. We want to assosiate this data list with the input 
        field, on the <input> we set the 'list' attribute, to associate the two
        elements.
      -->
      <datalist id="countries">
        <!--  
          One thing we want to take into consideration is that when we want to 
          send a numeric value to the server (we could have a database, with 
          a list of countries, and each country is gonna have a unique id), so
          when submitting this form, we want to send a unique id, so we know what
          country the user has selected.
          We set this using the 'value' attribute, but if we only use this, that
          value is going to be displayed on the input field.
          We dont want to show the user this value, we can hide it, by using
          a 'data' attribute. In HTML if we type the type 'data-', we can create
          our own custom attribute, and with JavaScript we can read the value
          of this attribute and submit it to the server.

          Another thing to consider is that when we are working with suggestion
          lists, we want to turn off the autocomplete feature of the browser.
          So if the user has previously typed something in this textbot, we 
          dont want an extra tooltip or autocomplete in this value.
          For this we set the 'autocomplete' attribute to 'off', this will
          turn off the native autocomplete feature in the browser.
        -->
        <option value="1" autocomplete="off">Australia</option>
        <option data-value="2">Canada</option>
        <option>India</option>
        <option>United States</option>
      </datalist>
