    <title>Data Validation</title>
    <!--  
      Before submiting a form, we should always validate the data and make
      sure its in the right shape. For exampel if you have required fields, 
      you want to make sure that they are filled out, if you have email 
      addresses you want to make sure that its a right address, etc.

      We should always validate the data to prevent data corruption or 
      security atacks.

      HTML elements come with built in validation, we can perform basic
      checks, but for anything more complex, we have to use JavaScript.

  <body>
    <!-- 
      To use the built in validation in HTML elements, we use the 'require'
      boolean attribute.
      We can set the minum characters to type with 'minlenght'.
      Similarly we have 'maxlenght', a good rule if to always use maxlenght
      to prevent people from entering really long strings.

      For email and date fields, the validation comes by default, the user
      must enter valid strings.

      For numbers we have two other attributes, 'min' and 'max', we should 
      always validate number fields, so we dont get negative or long numbers
      values, they could cause data corruption.
