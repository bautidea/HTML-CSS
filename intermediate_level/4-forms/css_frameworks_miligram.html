    <title>CSS Frameworks</title>
    <!--  
      As we saw styling forms can be a time consuming work, this is why people use 
      CSS frameworks. A framework is essentially a library of code (CSS code 
      in this case) that we can reuse to build beautiful modern looking websites.

      For a lot of websites, most of the components that bootstrap has to offer and 
      having heavy loading css.files its not good or necessary. Then you might want 
      to use one of the minimalistic frameworks like Miligram.

      You can get it from - https://milligram.io/

      We can also load miligram from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

      Right out of the box you can see a really nice style.

        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input id="email" type="email" />
      </div>

      <button type="submit">Register</button>
      <button type="reset">Clear</button>
