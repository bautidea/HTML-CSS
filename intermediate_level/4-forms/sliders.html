      We define an input of type 'range', we type the min and max value 
      the slider should take, and the current value.
      To show the current value the slider is selecting we cannot do this 
      with HTML and CSS, we need javascript for that.
      Using JS we can listen to the changes in the slider, and doing so
      we can display the value that the slider is currently taking.
