    <title>CSS Frameworks - Bootstrap</title>
    <!--  
        As we saw styling forms can be a time consuming work, this is why people use 
        CSS frameworks. A framework is essentially a library of code (CSS code 
        in this case) that we can reuse to build beautiful modern looking websites.
        
        Some frameworks are:
        * Bootsrap (probably the most popular framework).
        * Foundation.
        * Semantic UI.
        * UI Kit.
        * Materialized.
        * Miligram (minimalistic framework when you dont want heavy loading CSS.files).
    -->

    <!--  
        For this example we are going to use Bootstrap using a CDN (short for Content
        Delivery Network), these CDN are esentially a bounch of servers that are 
        optimzed for delivering web assets like images, CSS files, JavaScript files, 
        and so on.

      For a lot of websites, most of the components that bootstrap has to offer and 
      having heavy loading css.files its not good or necessary. Then you might want 
      to use one of the minimalistic frameworks like Miligram.

      You can get it from - https://milligram.io/

      We can also load miligram from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

    <!-- 
      There is a structure that we need to follow when naming classes in Bootstrap, for example
      for label we use the name class='form-label', for input fields we use class='form-control',
      and fot buttons we have other classes, first off all every button should have the 'btn' class,
      this will apply the basic styles for the button, and the depending on the colour we want we have
      a second class it could be 'btn-primary' or 'btn-secondary' or 'btn-success' and so on.

      This is a downside of Bootstrap, there are a bounch of utility classes you have to be 
      aware off.

      By default the input fields will grow to take up the entire width of the page, we can apply
      a contraint to our <form> element, using a  utility class, class='w-50' ('width'), that means 50% of the width
      of the parent.

      class='mb-3' ('margin-bottom') indicates that we are leaving a margin-bottom in this element.
    -->
    <form class="w-50">
      <div class="form-group mb-3">
        <label class="form-label" for="name">Name</label>
        <input class="form-control" id="name" type="text" />
      </div>

      <div class="form-group mb-3">
        <label class="form-label" for="email">Email</label>
        <input class="form-control" id="email" type="email" />
      </div>

      <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Register</button>
      <button class="btn btn-secondary" type="reset">Clear</button>
    </body>
  </form>
