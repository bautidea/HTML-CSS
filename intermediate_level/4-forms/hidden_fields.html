    <!--  
        Hidden fiels are a type of <input> element, it is an invisible element
        that is used to send data to a server, in this case when loading a form
        the information on the 'value' attribute will be sended to a server.

        Even though they are invisible to the user, we should never store 
        sensitive values in them, because we can always find these values
        in the source code of the page.

        Hidden fields are often used for storing the ID if the content being 
        edited.
