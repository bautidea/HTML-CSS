    <title>Submitting the form</title>
    <!--  
      For submitting the form there are two attributes that we need to know.
      * 'action' - is where we are going to send the data, here we have to
      type a relative or an absolute URL, this is where you use back-end
      language or frameworks.
      * 'method' - With can either be 'GET' or 'POST'. its basically how 
      we are sending the data. 
      With 'POST' method form data is included in the body of the request.
      With 'GET' method, form data is included in the URL as query string
      parametrers.
      'GET' is used when we need to enable bookmarking pages, and 'POST' is 
      used when we need to uptade the data.

      To submit a form each <input> should have a name attribute.

      For this example we are going to use formspree.io/forms. In this web
      site we can create a project and in each project we can have one or 
      more forms. We just copy the URL this page give us and we paste it in
      the 'action' attribute.

  <body>
    <form action="https://formspree.io/f/xaygybzv" method="POST">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Name" name="name" />
      <input type="email" placeholder="Email" name="email" />
      <button type="submit">Submit-btn</button>
      <!--  
        There is another way of creating a submit button, we can add an input
        of type 'submit'.
        The difference is that with the input element, we can only type plain
        text, we can not add an icon, if you want to add an icon we have to
        use the <button> element.
      -->
      <input type="submit" value="Submit-input" />
    </form>
  </body>
