        If you want to type multiple lines of text, we'll have to use a <textarea> element.

        <textarea cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>

        By default textarea comes with the atributes, 'cols="30"' (which represents the number of columns 
        or caracters in a line) and 'rows="10"' (which represents the number of lines).
        But when using Milligram if we change the number of this attributes ('cols' and 'rows'),
        we are not going to see any differences, because of the hight milligram applies to this
        input field. 
        We can change that using CSS. For this demo im going to delete this attributes.

      <textarea></textarea>

      <!--  
        The input fields have a few attributes that we need to be familiar with.
        * 'value' - we can use this to prepopulate an input field.
        * 'placeholder' - is used to show text that when you start typing in the input field
        it disappear.
        * 'readonly' - With this the user cannot change value of this input field.
        * 'disabled' - With this we cannot even select the input that the attribute is associated to.
        When submitting the form, this value will not be sent to the server, thats the difference 
        between 'readonly' and 'disabled'.
        * 'maxlength' - Its used for validation. Depending in the value its setted, the user can only
        type characters up to the value that it was specified.
        * 'autofocus' - When the page loads, the first input field with this attribute gets automatically
        focused (useful for log-in and registration forms).
