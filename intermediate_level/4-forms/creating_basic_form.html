  <body>
    <!--  
      We start by creating the <form> element. Inside this form we are gonna have one or more 
      <input> fields, called 'form controls'.
    -->
    <form>
      <!-- 
        Each input has a type. If we set the type to 'text', we get a senior line text field.
        Before each input field we want to have a lable, we create it using the <label>
        element.
        This both elements will laid horizontally because <label> is an inline-element. This element
        has a 'for' attribute, with it we can associate this label with the input field below.
        To do that we give an unique identifier (id) to the input field.

        We wrap this two elements with a div in order for them to display one below the other.
      -->
      <div>
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input id="name" type="text" />
      </div>

      <!--  
        Here we change the type attribute of the input field to 'email', by doing this we will get
        basic validation in this field
      -->
      <div>
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input id="email" type="email" />
      </div>

      <!-- 
        Adding the submit button. Each <button> element has a type, in which we indicate the button action.
      -->
      <button type="submit">Register</button>
      <button type="reset">Clear</button>
    </form>
  </body>
