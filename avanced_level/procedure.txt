                    --------------- Color Palette ---------------

Before bulding any components, we start off by defining our color palette. The palette
often include a Primary color, a Secondary color and an Accent color.

Opening the standard.psd in photoshop we can check this colors.

I am going to create my color palette using variables, so i can reuse them in multiple places.

            :root {
            --primary_color: #2584ff;
            --secondary_color: #00d9ff;
            --accent_color: #ff3400;
            --heading_color: #1b0760;
            --text_color: #918ca4;
            }

                    --------------- Typography ---------------

Since i am going to take the mobile 1st approach im going to see the mobile design of the page
in photoshop, file - mobile.psd.

Here we have the same font in all the page (Inter), except for the name of the person giving 
the statement (Montserrat).

Since theres only one place where the Montserrat font is used, im going to change it. Because
every time we import a new font, we're increasing the cost of downloading our page, so i want 
to minimize the number of fonts that are displayed.

After that i imported the used font with its weights from google fonts, and gave all the 
required styles to match the web page.
